# PolyFit

PolyFit is a Flask application that accepts a series of data points and a degree n and applies and plots a polynomial regression model of degree n on the given data. The model uses [least squares approximation](http://math.mit.edu/~gs/linearalgebra/ila0403.pdf) and was implemented from scratch using NumPy's linear algebra module.

The resulting model function, along with the original data points are plotted using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
